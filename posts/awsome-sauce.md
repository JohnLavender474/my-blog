This is a quick update alongside my blog post about starting at Rocket Partners. As I mentioned in that blog post,
my role at Rocket Partners is as a Java Cloud Engineer. This means that I'm assigend to work with Java and cloud 
technologies. 

To prepare for cloud development, which is completely new for me, I decided to take a quick dive into AWS by following
along with a Udemy course. The course was called "Introduction to Cloud Computing on AWS for Beginners [2024]" by 
Neal Davis.

The course was a great introduction to AWS. It covered the basics of cloud computing, the AWS console, and the various
services that AWS offers. I learned about EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and more. I also learned about the AWS CLI and how to
use it to interact with AWS services.

I'm excited to start working with AWS at Rocket Partners. I think it's going to be a great learning experience and I'm
looking forward to it. I'll be sure to keep this blog updated with what new projects I take on!
