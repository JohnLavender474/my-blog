It's been a long while since I've last written a blog post. I've been too caught up with life to sit down and jot
it all down. I'll make an exception for today, however.

I'm excited to announce that I've recently joined Rocket Partners as a Java Cloud Engineer. The journey to this point
was tough to put it lightly. After months of constantly applying and interviewing, receiving nothing but automated
rejections, and feeling like I was stuck in a rut, I finally received an offer from Rocket Partners after a grueling
interview process. They had me do a behavioral phone interview, a technical questionnaire, a live coding challenge
in Java, a final interview with the CEO, and on top of all that a take-home project also in Java. It was a lot of work,
and frankly, towards the end of the process, I had already mentally prepared myself for the worst: a soulless automated
rejection email. It wouldn't have been the first time such commitment and effort got shot down. But it wasn't. I got 
the offer. I was ecstatic. I was over the moon. I was finally going to start my career as a Java developer which is
really what I wanted to do ever since I graduated from college.

I've been at Rocket Partners for a few weeks now, and although I can always find things to complain about, I'm just
happy to have a job that I'm able to enjoy. I'm working with a great team of engineers, and I'm learning a lot.

In the onboarding process, Wells (the CEO) had myself and two of the other new hires sit down with him for a meeting
where he explained to us what our onboarding project would be. We were to build a mock POS system that would be used
to handle (fictional) transactions. The project would entail three phases: (1) develop a fully working desktop app
in Java Swing to simulate the components of a POS system (handling the transaction process, storing a pricebook, 
generating a receipt, etc.), (2) write a backend in Spring Boot that would serve as the Pricebook API, and have it
Dockerized and deployed into AWS for the Swing app to communicate with, and (3) introduce socket programming into the
POS Swing app to simulate a real-time one-way communication from the POS system to a logging device. Currently, we
are at the end of phase 1 and are about to start phase 2. It's been an enjoyable onboarding project and I think it's 
a great decision on Wells' part to have new hires work on this type of project. It helps to introduce many important
concepts and technologies that we will be using in our day-to-day work at Rocket Partners.

Besides the onboarding project, I've also already been assigned Jira tickets to work on. I've been tasked with things 
like updating the README for a repo to make it more friendly for onboarding, rewrite dozens of unit tests that are 
failing, and go through the code to provide default values for fields where a default value might be needed. Yeah,
these don't sound too exciting on the surface, but these tickets are the perfect kind of tasks for me to get my feet
wet with the codebase and the technologies that Rocket Partners uses. I'm excited to see what other tasks I'll be
assigned in the future.

Recently, I got a message from my manager where he told me that he really liked my knack for documentation in the 
codebase and in the PRs that I've been submitting. I'm very glad to have received this feedback. I've always been a
fan of writing documentation, and I'm glad that it's being appreciated. Frankly, this was one area that seemed to 
be greatly lacking when I worked at McKenney's. There, no one seemed to have any inclination or real appreciation 
for thoroughly documenting processes. Too many times things would have to be inferred over meetings or phone calls 
rather than having them written down. I did a lot of documentation work while at McKenney's, but it seemed to largely
go unnoticed. So, with all that being said, I'm glad to have finally reached a position where my contributions can feel
meaningful and impactful.

As I mentioned earlier, there's some things I can't help but complain about. The biggest one is the CEO's insistence
that employees hired after January 2024 work fully in the office. Of course, the reasons mentioned for this are that
it's important for team bonding and collaboration, and that it's important for the company culture. In some ways, I
can understand that. There have been times here where being able to get help or have discussions in person has been
beneficial. However, at the same time, I think it's not a secret among anyone who's been paying attention lately what
the big reason for this push for RTO is. It's money. Companies that have offices and that require office attendance 
receive tax breaks from the local government. Time will only tell how long this trend lasts among companies. I'm a 
strong supporter in remote work being the first option for employees. It cuts down on commute time, pollution, and 
stress. It allows greater flexibility for people to choose where they want to live. I know for my case, that means
being able to live outside the metro area where it's cheaper and more enjoyable for myself and my partner. So, with 
all that being said, I can't help but feel that the insistence on being in the office is too much. My past positions 
at Ware2Go and McKenney's were both (mostly) remote, and I never felt like I was missing out on anything. Luckily, the 
"insistence" that we work five days a week in the office seems so far to be more of a "strong suggestion" than a 
"requirement". Of course, as a new hire, I don't want to rock the boat too much and risk my job, so I've been in the 
office for most days, but at the same time, I've taken a few days to work from home (with of course marking my work 
calendar accordingly to ensure that everyone knows where I am). I'm hoping that this "strong suggestion" doesn't turn 
into a "requirement" in the future. I'm not sure if I could handle working in the office five days a week for the rest 
of my career or even for a year or two more. I guess only time will tell.

So, there's good and bad with every change in life. But I'm just glad that this change of positions has been mostly for
the better. I'm glad that I'm finally in a position where I can feel like I'm making a difference in my trajectory and 
where my contributions are being appreciated. I'm excited to see where this journey at Rocket Partners takes me next!
