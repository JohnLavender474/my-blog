It's been a long while since I've last written a blog post. I've been too caught up with life to sit down and jot
it all down. I'll make an exception for today, however.

I'm excited to announce that I've recently joined Rocket Partners as a Java Cloud Engineer. The journey to this point
was tough to put it lightly. After months of constantly applying and interviewing, receiving nothing but automated
rejections, and feeling like I was stuck in a rut, I finally received an offer from Rocket Partners after a grueling
interview process. They had me do a behavioral phone interview, a technical questionnaire, a live coding challenge
in Java, a final interview with the CEO, and on top of all that a take-home project also in Java. It was a lot of work,
and frankly, towards the end of the process, I had already mentally prepared myself for the worst: a soulless automated
rejection email. It wouldn't have been the first time such commitment and effort got shot down. But it wasn't. I got 
the offer. I was ecstatic. I was over the moon. I was finally going to start my career as a Java developer which is
really what I wanted to do ever since I graduated from college.

I've been at Rocket Partners for a few weeks now, and so far the experience has been wonderful.
I'm working with a great team of engineers, and I'm learning a lot.

In the onboarding process, myself and two of the other new hires were assigned to build a mock POS system that would be used
to handle (fictional) transactions. The project would entail three phases: (1) develop a fully working desktop app
in Java Swing to simulate the components of a POS system (handling the transaction process, storing a pricebook, 
generating a receipt, etc.), (2) write a backend in Spring Boot that would serve as the Pricebook API, and have it
Dockerized and deployed into AWS for the Swing app to communicate with, and (3) introduce socket programming into the
POS Swing app to simulate a real-time one-way communication from the POS system to a logging device. Currently, we
are at the end of phase 1 and are about to start phase 2. It's been an enjoyable onboarding project and I think it's 
a great decision on management's part to have new hires work on this type of project. It helps to introduce many important
concepts and technologies that we will be using in our day-to-day work at Rocket Partners.

Besides the onboarding project, I've also already been assigned Jira tickets to work on. I've been tasked with things 
like updating the README for a repo to make it more friendly for onboarding, rewrite dozens of unit tests that are 
failing, and go through the code to provide default values for fields where a default value might be needed. Yeah,
these don't sound too exciting on the surface, but these tickets are the perfect kind of tasks for me to get my feet
wet with the codebase and the technologies that Rocket Partners uses. I'm excited to see what other tasks I'll be
assigned in the future.

Recently, I got a message from my manager where he told me that he really liked my knack for documentation in the 
codebase and in the PRs that I've been submitting. I'm very glad to have received this feedback. I've always been a
fan of writing documentation, and I'm glad that it's being appreciated.

Overall, I'm glad to be in a position where I can feel like I'm making a difference in my trajectory and 
where my contributions are being appreciated. I'm excited to see where this journey at Rocket Partners takes me next!
