About three weeks ago, I started a part-time position as a Deli Associate at Prince Market, a grocery store that opened nearby where I live.

It's not exactly a position to be showing off on Linkedin considering I'm a CS major with software engineering experience. Nevertheless, the reason for sharing this news is because this part-time gig is in conjunction to my other part-time job as a TA at UGA and also my 15-hour course schedule this semester. Suffice it to say, I'm really strapped for free time - my weekdays are loaded with work for my courses and TA job, and the weekends are loaded up with hours at the deli job.

But, it's all necessary to make ends meet as I continue pursuing my degree. It's not easy to make ends meet sometimes, and I don't want to feel ashamed about working at a deli. In fact, it's in some ways pretty fun and rewarding to interact with the customers there and prepare sandwiches and pizzas for them. It's not what I want to do for a living, of course, but things are far from bad for me.

As I rush through the end of this semester, I'm hoping it's all worth it in the end. I'm really looking forward (to the point of near impatience) to my internship at McKenney's this January and seeing where that experience leads me to!

As Chief Dan told Clint Eastwood in the immortal 1976 film "The Outlaw Josey Wales", "Endeavor to persevere..."
