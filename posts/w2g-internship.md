# Introduction
Allow me to take you through my Summer 2023 development experience at Ware2Go. I should qualify that development here
means both code-development and self-development! This was my first swoop into the professional world,  progressing from
mock projects in the classroom and personal projects over to industry-grade services written by a swathe of talented developers.
In this blog post, I'll share my journey of defeating initial anxieties, seizing challenges, grasping new tech skills, and
ultimately developing myself as a collaborative, results-driven developer.

# Seizing the Initial Nerves
My journey began with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. The vast chasm between classroom concepts and real-world implementation was 
both daunting and intriguing. Despite the jitters, I quickly realized that my passion for learning and diving into new tasks could 
overcome any initial apprehensions.

# Learning the Ropes and Lassoing Achievements Out of Challenges
One of the most striking aspects of my internship was the rapidity with which I adapted to new technologies. The company's codebase 
predominantly used Kotlin and Typescript, and while initially foreign, I quickly became adept at these languages. With the guidance of my 
supervisor, Alex, and the fellow intern, Charles, I grasped how to approach tasks with confidence, learning on the fly, and 
handling the unexpected.

# From Bug Squashing to Feature Building
In the initial weeks, Charles, Alex, and I formed a dynamic team, working collaboratively to fix a bug in a Kafka service. 
Our combined efforts culminated in the successful resolution of the issue, instilling in me a sense of accomplishment and teamwork. 
Subsequently, our tandem efforts extended to implementing a new API endpoint in a Typescript service. While Charles handled database and 
deployment, I undertook the controller and service components, fostering a synergy that exemplified our evolving capabilities.

# Solo Ventures and Architectural Insights
As the internship progressed, my role transitioned to independent problem-solving. Tackling bugs, comprehending intricate code, 
and deciphering the company's architectural patterns, I gradually became a confident code connoisseur. The once perplexing codebase 
now revealed its secrets, leading to a heightened ability to troubleshoot and innovate.

# Progress Meetings and Surpassing Expectations
Every two weeks, my mentor Alex and I engaged in progress meetings that served as milestones in my growth. Alex's guidance and 
encouragement fostered an environment where Charles and I exceeded expectations, effectively propelling the team forward. 
Our adeptness at tackling tasks and swiftly comprehending complex challenges impressed both Alex and the senior developers.

# Joining the Squad and Embracing Collaboration
Halfway through the internship, my role evolved to that of a team player within a squad. This transition marked a pivotal point in my 
journey, as I exchanged predominantly independent work for collaborative endeavors. Given tasks by the product owner, Addie, I felt 
empowered to contribute to bug fixes and feature implementations, thus solidifying my status as a valuable member of the team.

# Working Hours and Real-World Experience
My internship demanded dedication, with workweeks varying between 35 and 45 hours. These hours, while occasionally challenging, 
forged an authentic understanding of the industry's demands. The real-world experience gained during this period was immeasurable, 
providing insights beyond the classroom and personal projects.

# A Journey Well Worth It
As the summer internship drew to a close, I found myself reflecting on a transformative experience. From nervously stepping into the 
unknown to confidently crafting solutions and working collaboratively, I emerged with a deep sense of pride in my achievements. 
My newfound skills, honed over the course of two months, extended beyond technical proficiency; they encompassed adaptability, 
teamwork, and a steadfast commitment to growth.

# A Grateful Farewell to Ware2Go
My summer internship at Ware2Go was a journey of growth, learning, and surpassing expectations. From the initial nerves to becoming 
an integral team player, I'm grateful for the opportunities, mentorship, and camaraderie that have shaped my professional debut. 
As I step forward, armed with invaluable hands-on experience, I am excited to carry the lessons learned and the achievements 
earned into my future endeavors.
