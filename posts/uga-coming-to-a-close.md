## Looking Back

As I look back and reflect on my undergraduate journey, I am reminded of the mistakes, missed opportunities, challenges, and growth I have done and felt along the way. I think about how naive I was when first starting college, and how much I've learned to perceive the world differently since then. I think about the arduous effort I put into my studies, the many times I suffered from crushing loneliness as I failed again and again to form friendships and relationships, and how I've grown to become a more confident, self-assured, and independent person through sheer brute force and trial and error.

## Decay of Dedication

I'd be lying if I said I still feel the same amount of educational curiosity and vigor that I felt years ago when first starting university. Above all else, I feel burnt out and ready to find myself beyond the confines of the classroom. I'm ready to start earning serious income and building a life for myself. In fact, I'm writing this blog post while sitting in class. The lecture is nothing more than a mostly incoherent drone in my ears -- something about relational databases and object persistence, things I already have some knowledge about. I have an internship that's supposed to start in a few months in January, and I'm just counting down the days to start it. As I start to lose focus in my classes, and especially as I watch the number in my checking account go down and the number on my credit card go up, I grow impatient. I feel like my life is on pause, in limbo. I'm pushing through the classes, making sure I get good grades, but it's a real struggle to retain enough motivation to get it done.

## Purging the Pressures

Growing up, I felt like I was never enough. When my stepfather coached me to play baseball through my teenage years, I felt like I wasn't good enough, and it lead to constant bouts of crying and falling apart emotionally. During my internship job searches as a rising software engineer, I never took the barrage of rejections well. I question myself a lot. I stress myself out so much thinking about what I could be doing differently at any given moment. A little more than six months ago, I met my girlfriend. I'd never been in a romantic relationship before meeting her (regardless of my persistent and many times embarrassing prior efforts). I've seen many people say that if you're not happy with yourself, you won't be happy in a relationship, but I beg to differ. It's through each other that we construct and realize ourselves. I realized this through my experience with her. I've improved myself so much while being and living with her. If it weren't for her, I'd still be lost in this world. And it's through my experience with her that I've also finally come to realize how lucky I am to have people in my life like her, my brothers, and my father. It's an ongoing process to purge these internal pressures and learn to live and be happy with who I am.


## The Forwardness of Hindsight

We see the future best through the lens of the past and present. I see my life building up. I don't know what it's building up to, but I feel that vague feeling like I'm on the right track. Although I suffer sometimes from imposter syndrome and a lack of self-confidence, I try my best to remain calm and proud about my circumstances, where I've been, and where I'm going.
