Embarking on my first day as an Automations and Control Solutions Engineer Co-Op at McKenney's, I, along with my fellow co-ops, had the valuable opportunity to tour the manufacturing and construction facilities. This experience provided a firsthand look into the intricate synergy between workers and automated machinery, unveiling the remarkable efficiency with which processes like welding, machining, etc. are executed. Guiding us through this exploration was one of the project directors, who offered insights into the role of automations and controls engineers. During a moment in the tour, I took the chance to inquire about my specific role and how it contributed to the demonstrated processes.

He explained that automations and controls engineers play a crucial role in developing the logic behind automation systems, catering not only to customer requirements like HVAC but also addressing the needs of workers in automated tasks. My responsibilities would extend to developing the logic and UI for these systems, involving both frontend and backend development. Particularly intriguing was the revelation that the backend development would leverage AI to "smarten" these control systems, adding a layer of intelligence to the overall automation framework.

In summary, my anticipation is fueled by the prospect of immersing myself in the intricacies of automation processes that drive industry acceleration, honing my skills in both frontend and backend development, and gaining deeper insights into the application of AI within the fascinating realm of manufacturing and construction automation and control systems. The journey ahead promises not only professional growth but also a unique opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge advancements in the field.
