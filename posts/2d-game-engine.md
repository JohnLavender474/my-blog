From as far back into my childhood as I can remember, I've always been fascinated by video games. 
I fondly remember playing for many hours on the Super Nintendo that belonged to my older brother.
We had games like Super Mario World, Megaman X, Donkey Kong Country, Star Fox, and many more. 
Playing games was a way for me to escape, even for a moment, the trialing times of my childhood.

ideas for my own games. When I wasn't playing games with a controller, I was playing them through
my thoughts and daydreams. Maybe it was an unhealthy addiction, or maybe not. 

Fast-forward many years later to my late teens and early twenties. Although I was much of a gamer in
my earlier teenage years, I had begun to slowly distance myself somewhat from gaming by my late teens.
After high school, I
