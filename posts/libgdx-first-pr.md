## My Journey into Open Source and Game Development

I recently had the exhilarating experience of making my inaugural contribution to an open-source project. This significant milestone in my programming journey involved submitting a pull request (PR) to the LibGDX project. The PR aimed to address a user-reported issue, specifically, the need to extract "object" type custom properties from Tiled objects.

## Tackling the Challenge

For this endeavor, I delved into the codebase, making pivotal changes to the `BaseTmxMapLoader` class. In addition to code modifications, I also created a `GdxTest` instance to comprehensively evaluate the impact of my changes. With my PR ready, I sought the guidance of the LibGDX community on Discord, requesting a thorough review.

## A Community of Collaborators

I was pleasantly surprised when one of the community members generously volunteered to review my code. Their feedback was insightful, suggesting some enhancements to tidy up the code. However, what truly warmed my heart was their appreciation for the improvements I had introduced. This sense of camaraderie and support within the open-source community filled me with immense joy.

My journey into open source and game development has been a thrilling one, filled with challenges, learning, and a supportive community. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next!
